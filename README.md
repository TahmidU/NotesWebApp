# About

This is a simple ReactJS web app with a responsive UI that utilises backend technologies such as Spring Boot for the API and Server App; Hibernate as the ORM and H2 as the RDBMS for data persistence.

I have only tested this on Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. It seems to also work on the Android Chrome Browser. As for Apple devices, I am not all too sure how the UI would look, as I do not have any Apple devices to verify.
